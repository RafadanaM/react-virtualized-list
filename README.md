# React List Virtualization

List Virtualization in React from scratch, the hook's APIs are inspired by TanstackVirtual, but the internals of the hooks are built by me.

I made this to learn more about List Virtualization.

## Features:
- Fixed & Dynamically sized items
- Overscan (render additional items outside of viewport)
- Gap between items

## Todo:
- Handle changing item count (current measureElement implementation will break if item count increases)
- Window scroll

## Running the program:
- usual pnpm + vite react stuff
